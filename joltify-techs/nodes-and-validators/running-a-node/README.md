# Running a Fullnode

A full node is a program that fully validates transactions and blocks of a blockchain. It is distinct from a light node that only processes block headers and a small subset of transactions. Running a full-node requires more resources than a light-node but is necessary in order to be a validator. In practice, running a full-node only implies running a non-compromised and up-to-date version of the software with low network latency and without downtime.

It is encouraged for users to run full-nodes even if they do not plan to be validators.

You can join Joltify network as a node by selecting one of the options below.
