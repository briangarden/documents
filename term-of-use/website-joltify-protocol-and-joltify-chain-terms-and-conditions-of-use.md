**About Joltify protocol**

(c) Joltify is a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain that aims to bridge real world assets to the decentralized finance world. Joltify is a lending platform for lending and borrowing cryptocurrency tokens, such as USDT,Atom, BNB, etc. Joltify is designed to amalgamate liquidity in the crypto world to real world financial assets and lending opportunities. Joltify will allow traditional asset managers and commercial borrowers to tokenise and/or borrow funds or cryptocurrencies, by minting tokens on Joltify (“Products”) and offer real world asset investment opportunities and/or lending opportunities to accredited investors via cryptocurrency and smart contracts or other blockchain technologies.

(d) Blockchain is a rapidly changing technology. The crypto industry also involves rapidly changing business models. We and Joltify DAO reserve the right to make changes to our Services, technology and business models, including but not limited to developing new Products and Services for broad applications, or moving to other blockchains or changing to other blockchain applications completely. We and Joltify DAO will give you reasonable prior notice of any material changes to the Services, our technology or business model, and inform you of any impact of these changes on any transactions entered by you under the Terms. We and Joltify DAO will continue to support any pending transactions entered into in reliance on the Terms notwithstanding any changes to the Services, our business models, or technology. These Terms will continue to apply in respect of any pending transactions entered into under these Terms. &#x20;

(e)Joltify is using bridge technology developed by the team at DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC as part of the Services. This technology is an open-source software licensed under the Apache v2 license and can be used freely by any third parties. The purpose of using the bridge in Joltify is to make it easy to transfer tokens in and out of the platform.

DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC may continue to develop and use its bridge technology in other projects that the Company develops. Joltify may not follow all updates to the bridge technology, as its current business model is focused on digital and real-world asset lending. The purpose of Joltify's use of the bridge is not to generate revenue, though it may potentially bring value to JOLT token in other ways.

In the future, Joltify may choose to terminate the use of the Company's bridge in its own chain and instead use bridges from other projects or chains as part of the Services, either from DEEP THOUGHT VENTURES 42 INC or from other third-party projects,softwares or chains, in order to diversify risks and focus on its core business.

&#x20;

(a) Both parties confirm and declare that the provisions of the Terms are fair and reasonable and both parties having taken the opportunity to obtain independent legal advice.

(b) User acknowledges that Blockchains and smart contracts are still emerging technologies that carry a relatively high amount of foreseeable and unforeseeable risk from security, financial, technical, political, social, and personal safety standpoints. For example, User’s assets interacting with the Services may be vulnerable to hacking events, including Bridge Risks described in (c). The mere access to and interaction with blockchains and smart contracts requires a high degree of skill and knowledge to operate with a relative degree of safety and proficiency. Crypto-assets are highly volatile in nature due to many diverse factors, including (without limitation) use and adoption, speculation, manipulation, technology, security, and legal and regulatory developments and application. Further, the speed and cost of transacting with cryptographic technologies (such as blockchains) is variable and highly volatile. Moreover, the transparent nature of many blockchains means that any interactions the User has with the Website may be publicly visible and readable in human form.

(c)Decentralized management accounts in both public chains and Joltify are shared by all Users. While this adds liquidity to the bridge, it also increases the risk of the bridge being hacked or suffering from other issues (“Bridge Risks”). Building a bridge between different chains is a complex task, and the rapidly changing nature of blockchain technology adds to the difficulty. For example, transferring tokens between chains does not physically move tokens from one chain to another, but involves locking tokens in one chain and releasing tokens in another chain, i.e. tokens are pooled rather than atomic stored. Despite this, the bridge is a crucial function in connecting different chains, as without it, block chains are like isolated islands. We will take all necessary measures to protect the safety of the accounts and the bridge, but there is no guarantee that the bridge will be completely risk-free. Users should be aware that they bear the risks of hacking, chain breaks, liquidity crunches, and other issues if they choose to use the bridge as part of the Services and Joltify chain.
